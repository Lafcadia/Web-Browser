## Web-Browser

PySide6 is a widely used module which is used to make GUI applications with much ease. We can develop many complex GUI applications using it very easily. It has a modern look and light user interface. Even if you are not familiar with this module, you will be able to create a web browser as each and every line is explained in the code itself using comments.

The browser will have the following features:
- A Previous Button: to navigate to the previously visited site.
- A Next Button: to navigate to the next visited site.
- A Refresh Button: to reload the current site.
- A Search Bar: to load the entered url.
- A home button: to navigate back to home.

## How to Install?
1. Install Python 3 (which includes a pip).
2. Open a terminal (Terminal, cmd, Powershell, etc.) in the main folder of the repository.
3. Input "pip install requirements.txt".
4. It is done!
